# VibeVoice Research Plan

## Research Query
Research Microsoft VibeVoice and how it could substitute current TTS systems to be more than just TTS - making it feel like someone is actually explaining the text that's input, with natural expressiveness. Also explore how it can give voice to AI-generated responses.
